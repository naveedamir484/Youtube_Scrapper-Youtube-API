In this he is alternately aided and hampered by the Lilliputian town crier and general fussbudget, Gabby. A life-threatening situation develops when the bumbling trio of Blefiscu spies, Sneak, Snoop, and Snitch, manage to steal Gulliver's pistol. \n\nMax Fleischer's animated feature-length classic of Gulliver's adventures in Lilliput was the first full-length animated childrens cartoon after Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\n\nThis film is in the public domain."

Directed by Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale and produced by Don Hahn, the film\\'s voice cast features Tom Hulce, Demi Moore, Tony Jay, Kevin Kline, Paul Kandel, Jason Alexander, Charles Kimbrough, David Ogden Stiers, and Mary Wickes in her final film role.\n\nIn 1482 Paris, Clopin, a gypsy puppeteer, narrates the origin of the titular hunchback. A group of gypsies sneak illegally into Paris, but are ambushed by Judge Claude Frollo, the Minister of Justice of Paris, and his soldiers. A gypsy woman in the group attempts to flee with her deformed baby, but Frollo chases and kills her outside Notre Dame. He tries to kill the baby as well, but the cathedral\\'s archdeacon intervenes and accuses Frollo of murdering an innocent woman. To atone for his sin, Frollo reluctantly agrees to raise the deformed child in Notre Dame as his son, naming him \"Quasimodo\"...............\n\nThank for wathing, dont forget like, share, comement...\n\nGoogle + :https://goo.gl/am9pzj"

It stars Julian Lennon as both the speaking and singing voice of its protagonist.\nLike the novel it was based on, the film starts with David\\'s birth in Blunderstone, England in 1820. His great-aunt Betsey takes great offence to his being born a boy and storms out, but David\\'s mother and their faithful servant Peggotty dote on him. David (nicknamed \"Davey\") grows up happy, but his mother is frail and feels they need someone to take care of them. So she marries the wealthy but blackhearted cheese merchant, Edward Murdstone who wastes no time sending Davey to work as a slave in his cheese factory. Now, it\\'s up to Davey to escape Murdstone and his dim-witted partner Grimby and save not just his mother but the other orphans that have been taken by Murdstone. Oh yeah, and there\\'s a giant vulture mixed in there somewhere too.\nDid we mention David is an anthropomorphic cat in this version? Or that it\\'s an Anthropomorphic Animal Adaptation set in a World of Funny Animals?\nAs you can probably tell, \"loose adaptation\" doesn\\'t quite do it justice.\nIt was made for and first broadcast on NBC during the holiday season and is now available on DVD from Good Times Entertainment."

The film, released in 2000, was directed by Kevin Altieri and produced by Disney & WildStorm.  The film was distributed by Disney under Buena Vista Pictures & the Touchstone Pictures (Paramount dstributing DVD versions) banner and first screened for the general public at the Wizard World Chicago convention July 17–19, 1998.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, WildStorm owner Jim Lee put his company on the market as comic book sales began to decline. It was during this period that Disney Studios expressed interest in developing a Gen¹³ film. The film project was already in production when Lee began talks to sell WildStorm to DC Comics, a Time Warner company. The sale was finalized in January 1999. By the time the film was finished, Disney decided to shelve the film because they did not want to market a film with ties to a rival production company. Consequently, the film was never released in the U.S., but did receive a limited video release.\n\nRated: PG/PG-13 (Depends on Region)\nLanguage: English\n\nCopyright Note:\nI do NOT own Gen 13.\nGen 13 ©WildStorm/DC Comics"

                  "video_desc":"\"The 8 Man\" Character Bio:\n\n\n\n8 Man (8マン) or Eightman (エイトマン, Eitoman) is a manga and anime superhero created in 1963 by science fiction writer Kazumasa Hirai and manga artist Jiro Kuwata. He is considered Japan\\'s earliest cyborg superhero, predating even Kamen Rider (later that same year, Shotaro Ishinomori created Cyborg 009), and was supposedly the inspiration for RoboCop. The manga was published in Weekly Shōnen Magazine and ran from 1963 to 1966. The anime series, produced by Eiken with the TCJ Animation Center, was broadcast on Tokyo Broadcasting System, and ran from November 17, 1963, to December 31, 1964, with a total of 56 episodes (plus the \"farewell\" special episode, \"Goodbye, Eightman\"). \n\n\n\nPlot\n\nMurdered by criminals, Detective Yokoda\\'s body is retrieved by Professor Tani and taken to his laboratory. There, Tani performs an experiment that has failed seven times; Yokoda is the eighth subject to have his life force transferred into an android body. For the first time, the experiment succeeds. Yokoda is reborn as the armor-skinned android 8 Man, able to dash at impossible speeds, as well as shape-shift into other people. He shifts himself into Yokoda, this time christening himself as \"Hachiro Azuma\". He keeps this identity a secret, known only to Tani and his police boss Chief Tanaka. Even his girlfriend Sachiko and friend Ichiro do not know he is an android. As 8-Man, Hachiro fights crime (even bringing his own murderers to justice). To rejuvenate his powers, he smokes \"energy\" cigarettes that he carries in a cigarette case on his belt.\n\n\nProduction/Changes \n\nIn Japan, the character\\'s origin actually varies significantly between the original manga, the TV series, and the live-action movie. In the original Japanese manga and TV series, the character\\'s name does not change when he is reborn as 8 Man. The \"Detective Yokoda\" name was created for the live-action version. In the manga, Detective Azuma is trapped in a warehouse and gunned down, while the TV series has him killed when he is run over by a car. Also, in the Japanese story, the character is called \"8 Man\" because he is considered an extra member of the Japanese police force. There are seven regular police precincts and 8 Man is treated as an unofficial eighth precinct all to himself.\n\n\n\nThe Japanese manga was presented as serial novella stories along with a set of one-shot stories. Many of the stories were edited down and adapted for the TV series, but not all of them. The novella stories were originally printed on a weekly basis in Shukuu Shōnen Magazine in 16-page increments that consisted of 15 story pages and one title page. Ten additional one-shot stories were presented in seasonal and holiday specials of Shuukuu Shōnen Magazine. These stories were generally between 30-40 pages in length.\n\n\n\nIn the North American version of the series the resurrected detective/android is known as \"Tobor\" or the word \"robot\" spelled backwards. Tani is referred to as \"Professor Genius\" and the sobriquet of 8-Man is changed slightly to \"8th-Man\". The story content was clearly directed toward a wider audience of both young and adult viewers. Due to changes in cigarette advertising laws in the 1960s, television characters were not allowed to be seen smoking. As this was a major plot device in the series, the show was forced to be removed from broadcast in the United States. \n\n\n\n8 Man After Movie Info:\n\nIn mid-1993, the mantle of 8 Man was taken up by Hazama Itsuru in the OVA series 8 Man After. Existing in a world far more corrupt than that of his predecessor, the new 8 Man had no qualms about being extremely violent towards the cybernetic criminals who had murdered him previously. The movie aired on the Syfy Network, as part of its animated Sci-Fi Saturday program block. Licensed by Streamline Pictures where it went out of print until being released on DVD by Image Entertainment in 2001. It has since been released by Discotek Media in 2016 with Japanese audio and English subtitles for the first time."

I am sure it will be successful not only with the young audiences, but also for the elder generations. »\n\nBuddy ELIAS, President, ANNE FRANK FONDS, 1998\n\nA LETTER BY Simon WIESENTHAL\n\nI have now viewed the English version of your film based on the Diary of Anne frank. Thank you for sending me the tape.\n\nI must admit that at first had my doubts whether an animated film could do justice to Anne Frank’s Diary. I was therefore pleasantly surprised upon viewing it that the film doesn’t trivialize the story of Anne Frank and makes for exciting viewing. This depiction of the growing up of a vivacious young girl in very difficult and extremely threatening surroundings will touch the hearts of young viewers--and will hopefully lead them to be wary of all signs of collective hatred, racism and anti-Semitism. It is good that with such well-done animated film more young people can be reached than would be the case with the book alone.\n\nWith best regards,\nSincerely,\nSimon WIESENTHAL\n\n\"No previous adaptations of Anne Frank\\'s Diary have done so with the imagination and sensitivity that characterize the animated film ANNE FRANK\\'S DIARY. The attendant music manages to be both unobstructive and haunting at the same time. This inspiring and poignant film is a remarkable tribute to Anne Frank.\"\n\n-Carol Ann Lee (Historian, author of \\'Anne Frank: A biography\\')\n\n\"...The highly realistic animation offers suspenseful touches and unusual points of view, and the music by Carine Gutlerner is excellent: spare and evocative.\" \n\n-Reader, Chicago\n\n\" An animated version of Anne Frank\\'s famous diaries that makes her story easily accessible for a new generation without losing the power of the original text.(...) Most moving is Anne\\'s internal life, her reaction to their persecution, and subsequent life of total isolation, silence, terror and ultimately the positive and humanitarian attitude she is able to maintain. Complemented by cutting edge animation, the film\\'s most significant success is its ability to use the diary entries to create an Anne Frank who is compelling and endearing without being maudlin. \"\n\nYoshua Ford, Washington Film Festival\n\n\" Animated \"ANNE FRANK\" retells story superbly\". The movie is an achievement on several levels. Its aesthetic scheme is simple and unadorned enough to remind us that is a story of ordinary people thrust in into extraordinary circumstances, yet it\\'s also gorgeous enough to carry us through its feature length. Its slab of colors and simple but inviting composition suggest paintings of Edward Hopper.\" Betsy Sherman,\n\nBOSTON GLOBE\n\n\"This animated feature will undoubtedly remain the most beautiful adaptation of the most widely read work in the world.\nThe city of Amsterdam is depicted very realistically sometimes making viewers think they are really there.  The violin music moves our souls with its nostalgic air.  The constantly latent emotion grows within us.  Like the Diary, the movie ends when the attic occupants are arrested and the few lines that appear thereafter bring tears to our eyes and make us say: “Never again!”. \"\n\nYAHOO FRANCE\n\n\"By adapting the Diary of Anne Frank in animated form, you have proven your great talent for teaching by successfully producing strong and moving animated images.\nI am convinced your movie will not only contribute to making the Diary of Anne Frank better known but it will also spur the awareness of young people and adults, and send a universal message of respect for human beings.\"\n\nEUROPEAN JEWISH CONGRESS\n\n\"The animation is superb, the settings exquisite. It is true to life. The director documented his research, worked on the basis of photographs.  It is a true setting of the time.  It made me want to go to Amsterdam.  The tone of the Diary isn’t hopeless.  Anne Frank is neither a view of the camps or of destruction.  We know the family will die so there is great underlying emotion as we watch but the dialogue is full of humanity. \n\nI prefer this movie to Schindler’s List or Life is Beautiful.\"\n\nAnnette Wievorka (Historian), interviewed by L\\'EVENEMENT\n\nOriginal Soundtrack:\n\nCarine GUTLERNER, composition, conducting www.carinegutlerner.com \nLaurent KORCIA, violin*\nCarine GUTLERNER, piano*\nFlorence ROUSSIN, second violin\nVinciane BERANGER, alto\nXavier PHILLIPS, cello*\nEmmanuelle BERTRAND, second cello\nBernard CAZAURAN, doublebass\nPhilippe BERNOLD, flute*\nOlivier D’OISE, hobo \nRomain GUYOT, clarinet \nJean-François DUQUESNOY, bassoon\nHervé JOULAIN, horn\nEric SAMMUT, percussions\nChristine ICART, harp \nAriane JACOB, celesta\n* main soloists"

                  "video_desc":"ulliver\\'s Travels is a 1939 American cel-animated Technicolor musical feature film produced by Max Fleischer and directed by Dave Fleischer for Fleischer Studios. Released to cinemas in the United States on December 22, 1939[3] by Paramount Pictures, the story is a very loose adaptation of Jonathan Swift\\'s 1726 novel of the same name, specifically the first part which tells the story of Lilliput and Blefuscu, and centers around an explorer who helps a small kingdom who declared war after an argument over a wedding song. The film was the Fleischer Studios\\' first feature-length animated film, as well as the second animated feature film produced by an American studio after Walt Disney Productions\\' Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, as Paramount had commissioned the feature in response to the success of that film.[4] The sequences for the film were directed by Seymour Kneitel, Willard Bowsky, Tom Palmer, Grim Natwick, William Henning, Roland Crandall, Thomas Johnson, Robert Leffingwell, Frank Kelling, Winfield Hoskins, and Orestes Calpini. \n\n\nOn November 5, 1699, Lemuel Gulliver washes onto the beach of Lilliput after a storm at sea and ultimate shipwreck. Following the calm of the storm, the town crier Gabby stumbles across Gulliver in terror (\"All\\'s Well\") and rushes back to Lilliput to warn King Little of a \"giant on the beach\". As this is happening, King Little of Lilliput and King Bombo of Blefescu are signing a wedding contract between their children, Princess Glory and Prince David of Blefuscu, respectively. All is fine until an argument starts over which national anthem is to be played at the wedding; the anthem of Lilliput (\"Faithful\") or the anthem of Blefuscu (\"Forever\"). In fury, King Bombo cancels the wedding and declares war against Liliput. He quickly regrets this decision and decides that he should apologize and call off the war, until Gabby finally makes his way to warn King Little and one of the Lilliputian guards accidentally grabs King Bombo."

                  "video_desc":"comics - visual art - Green Lantern is an ongoing American comic-book series featuring the DC Comics heroes of the same name. The character\\'s first incarnation, Alan Scott, appeared in All-American Comics #16 (July 1940), and was later spun off into the first volume of Green Lantern in 1941. After 38 issues, that series was cancelled in 1949. When the Silver Age Green Lantern, Hal Jordan, was introduced, the character starred in a new volume of Green Lantern starting in 1960. Although Green Lantern is considered a mainstay in the DC Comics stable, the series has been cancelled and rebooted several times. The first series featuring Hal Jordan was cancelled at issue #224, but was restarted with a third volume and a new #1 issue in June 1990. When sales began slipping in the early 1990s, DC Comics instituted a controversial editorial mandate that turned Jordan into the supervillain Parallax and created a new protagonist named Kyle Rayner. This third volume ended publication in 2004, when the miniseries Green Lantern: Rebirth brought Hal Jordan back as a heroic character and made him the protagonist once again. After Rebirth\\'s conclusion, writer Geoff Johns began a fourth volume of Green Lantern from 2005 to 2011, and a fifth volume which started immediately after, this time initially showcasing both Hal Jordan and Sinestro as Green Lanterns (Wikipedia). \n\nIf you would like to learn how to make a motion comic, drop a question in the comments. Years have passed since Hal Jordan Green Lantern left the Justice League and he is comfortably done until a threat returns. Previous Indigo Tribe allies become foes. Hal Jordan/Green Lantern goes on both an emotional and phyisical journey that tests his abilities as the weilder of one of the universe\\'s deadliest weapons. Those new to the GL universe will see this movie to be both educational and eye-opening to the New 52 and its connection to the award winning story, Blackest Night. Sinestro , via the Guardians of the Universe‘s sacred book, exposes a conspiracy that could break the foundation of the Corps. The emotional spectrum becomes the weapon of choice as chaos approaches and death seems unavoidable. Is this the end?\n\nArt by:\nChristian Alamy, Doug Mahnke, Ethan Van Sciver, Renato Guedes\nCover by:\nMark Irwin, Doug Mahnke\nWritten by:\nGeoff Johns\nAdapted by:\nDarrell Harris \n\nVoice Over Cast\n\nGreen Lantern/Hal Jordan - Daniel Guadagnino\nGreen Lantern/Sinestro - Thomas Fears \nIndigo-1/Iroque - Beetlebottle\nWilliam \"Black\" Hand - Lance Newman\nStar Sapphire/Carol Ferris - Stephanie Garrido\nLantern Voz - PimpMasterBroda\nLyssa Drak and Indigo Tribe Ring - CSM\nTwin Guardians - Sharon Grunwald \nStar Sapphire Ring Voice - Emaline (Platinumpussycat)\nPrison Aliens - Stephen Cumberworth\nAbin Sur - Oppletron\nArin Sur - Myrna Wolfe-Maxwell\nArsona - Carolyn Potts\nGanthet/Guardian - Oppletron\nReegal (Ancient Guardian)- Steve Stanley\nPaalko/Guardian, Natromo, Extras - Darrell Harris (Director) \n\nPlease watch \"Welcome to DHVO Comics\" for a quick explanation of the channel and consider subscribing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baS4JHYW-rQ\n --~-- Join the DHVO family. \n\nInterested in voice acting?

                  "video_desc":"Watch the new movie of the Dark Knight ► Batman: Arkham Knight ◄ in full movie length and HD quality.\n✔ Subscribe:  http://bit.ly/FullHDvideos4me\n\nHello fans of the Dark Knight, who is also known as the Batman. I want to welcome you to my YouTube channel FullHDvideos4me.\n\nToday we are going to watch the new Batman movie, which is based on the Arkham Knight. By discovering the home of Batman, better known as Gotham City, we are going to face different villains of the DC Universe. The first villain Batman has to fight with is named Deathstroke. This protagonist of Batman: Arkham Knight is characterized by his advanced strength, intelligence and agility. Formerly a soldier of the U.S. Army, Deathstroke gives the dark knight a hard time today.\n\nA far uglier villain of Batman: Arkham Knight is named Killer Croc. The product of a genetic disorder is driven by a lust for blood and does not hesitate to work with other criminals of Gotham City to fight against Batman. The firefly represents another opponent in this full movie about the Dark Knight. This malicious character is a genuine pyromaniac and has scars all over his body. Furthermore, the full movie Batman: Arkham Knight includes the famous villain of the DC universe, named Copperhead. By fighting against Copperhead, Batman must be aware of her assassin skills.\n\nThe next villain on our list is titled Deadshot, better known as the world`s deadliest sharpshooter. Being an old enemy of Batman, the sniper has never missed a shot and as a result he has a kill quote of nearly 100%. Let`s come to the next villain of Batman: Arkham Knight, which responds to the name Electrocutioner. The Electrocutioner can be described as an egotistical street punk, who uses powerful shock gloves. Suffice it to say, Batman has considerable difficulties to defeat him. What would be Batman: Arkham Knight without a female villain? Shiva is part of Gotham City`s criminals and in possession of extremely dangerous martial art skills. It is also interesting to note that the Dark Knight aka Batman is impressed by her beauty. And  last but not least, our hero has to fight against Bane in the full movie Batman; Arkham City.\n\nIf you appreciate my video, please leave a like and comment.

The story arc consists of six issues from DC\\'s Justice League and Aquaman publications,[functioning in part as a larger buildup towards the \"Trinity War\" event. The plot was written by Geoff Johns, with art by Ivan Reis and Paul Pelletier. In the story, believing Atlantis to be under attack, King Orm declares war on the surface world. Aquaman\\'s allegiances are torn between his brother and the Justice League, while the latter group finds itself overwhelmed as the East Coast of the United States is swallowed by the ocean and the Atlantean royal troops march against humankind (Wikipedia). \n\nIf you would like to learn how to make a motion comic, drop a question in the comments. The Justice league is back and just in time for an epic crises between Atlantis and the \"Surface World\". Someone fired missiles into the seas and the current king, Orm (Simdrew1993), isn\\'t happy. Despite his ties to his brother Arthur Curry aka Aquaman (Don Ford), he seeks war to show the surface dwellers who they\\'re dealing with. The league does what they can to prevent destruction, but the death toll rises quickly. They decide it might be time to call in reinforcements.\n\n*Voice Cast*\n\nDon Ford - Aquaman\nSimdrew1993 - Orm\nPaul Hikari - Cyborg\nRuka Samuels - Mera\nPhoenix Emrys - Wonder Woman\nReniChan - Cheetah\nJoshua L.

When the Man of Steel loses some of his powers after an evil villain attacks him with Kryptonite though, he must overcome his obstacles and prove he really is a super man.\n\nSuperman: Requiem is a high-value fan-film that depicts the life of Superman several years after the events of Superman Returns, and takes into account the events of Superman (1978), Superman II (1980) and Superman Returns (2006), and focuses on an event by an evil villain who attempts to make Superman lose his powers. \n\nThe film was conceived in 2011 by producer Gene Fallaize who decided to he was going to make an independent Superman fan-film, and wrote the first draft of the script in less than a week. Fallaize brought Tony Cook on board to co-produce the project to allow him the freedom and time to direct the project. \n\nThe film was released globally online on 11.11.11 after a red carpet World Premiere in London's Odeon Covent Garden.\n\nFor more information visit www.themanofsteelisback.com or facebook.com/supermanrequiem"

                  "video_desc":"If you've never seen my movies before, what I do is try to tell the story of the game in movie format. The idea is to present the story in a way that feels complete and can be understood whether you've played the game or not.\n\nI capture the entire game's story, and edit together cutscenes and gameplay. The cutscenes obviously drive the story, but if you just show the cutscenes, you will be left confused as to what happened between cutscenes most of the time. So gameplay is necessary, but I do try to keep gameplay to only the minimum I need to tell the story. If I can find areas to cut down on that don't affect the story or the pacing of the movie, I will. \n\nI also try to keep the experience as close to a proper movie experience by removing anything that makes it super obvious that you're watching a game. Obviously, it includes gameplay, so that can only go so far, but I can remove HUD elements, button prompts, any on screen text or loading/saving indicators, etc. Thankfully, due to an ini file tweak in this game, I was able to entirely disable the HUD. For everything else that remained, I was able to either edit around them or use visual effects to remove them.\n\nFor those of you wondering, I'm playing this game on PC, with the graphics at max settings, including the advanced PhysX and DX11 effects. The hardware I'm using is:\n\nAMD Phenom II X4 965 3.4 GHz\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 480\n8 GB RAM\n1920x1080 @ 30fps\nMax Settings\n\nThe game does dip below 30fps in a few spots when a lot is happening on screen, especially when the more advanced effects are used, but for the most part it stayed at a pretty solid 30fps. I used a 30fps cap because I was recording at 30fps, but without the cap it often went up around 40-60fps.\n\nAs for future movies, the next movie I'm going to be making is The Last of Us: Left Behind. I will be using the PS4 Remastered edition for that. That game is being released on July 29th, and I will start making the movie then. It's a fairly short story so it shouldn't take long.\n\nAfter that I'm not sure what will be next. I have a few ideas lined up, including Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry and Liberation. I may also do the Cold, Cold Heart DLC from Arkham Origins, but I'm not sure yet. At the end of the year I will be working on AC Unity, and next year I will do Arkham Knight, Rise of the Tomb Raider and Uncharted 4 (some of those may be released 2016).\n\nFeel free to recommend me some games to try out. The games I listed above will take priority, but if I have extra time, I may look at some of the recommendations as well, but no promises. For the most part, the games I make into movies are going to be third person, and they're probably going to have motion capture or at least very good animated cutscenes, and the gameplay itself should have an overall cinematic feeling to it."

Hulk is one of the scientists who tried to recreate the Super Soldier Serum which originated Captain America in World War II, but when an exposure to high levels of Gamma Radiation instead of Vita Radiation went awry, the mild-mannered scientist found himself plagued with a peculiar condition; when angered or provoked, hulk would transform into the rage-fueled and nearly mindless green-skinned monster known as the Hulk. \n\nBig Hulk is created by modder Barak101\n\nSpider-Man (2002) is created by modder Meth0d\n\nThanks for watching\n\nLeave a comment on what battle you would like to see and dont forget to subscribe to my channel for more battles :)\n\nBe sure to check out other epic battles between superheroes:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0IC2jPAhnRIHT65FIODGROZhXgppETdy\n\n★ Hulk vs Spiderman (Civil War)\nhttps://youtu.be/TCFbmE3Fmks\n\n★ Spiderman vs Hulk\nhttps://youtu.be/wKsE7RGP_VY\n\n★ Ultimate Spiderman vs Hulk\nhttps://youtu.be/qBA-j_4ZByg\n\n★ Hulk vs Spiderman Enemies\nhttps://youtu.be/JzSS7D4WYs4\n\n★ The Incredible Hulk vs Spiderman\nhttps://youtu.be/4-Rf_hfnmrA\n\n\nScript by JulioNIB:\nhttp://gtaxscripting.blogspot.com/\n\nAll mods are available at \n\nhttp://gta5-mods.com\n\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/kiragaming"

He traverses time to right a violent, decades-past crime against his mother, but the ripples of his good intentions prove disastrous, as a fractured, alternate reality now exists in place of the familiar one. Stumbling through this twisted reality where even Superman is nowhere to be found, The Flash seeks the trusted wisdom of Batman, only to find a grittier, more violent Dark Knight in his place. Together with the help of Cyborg, they race to restore the continuity of Flash's original timeline while this new world is ravaged by a fierce war between Wonder Woman's Amazons and the Atlanteans, led by a battle hardened Aquaman. With breath taking action and an all-star voice cast featuring Kevin Conroy, C. Thomas Howell and Dana Delany, it's a bold, emotional vision that will forever change the landscape of the DC Universe!"

It is the first movie of MCU Phase 4. It serves as a prequel to Homecoming revealing Venom\\'s origins. It adapts an episode from the 1994 Spider-Man animated series.\n\nTom Hardy, who was nominated for an Oscar for his work in The Revenant, is in final negotiations to star in Venom as Eddie Brock, while Ruben Fleischer, best known for directing Zombieland, is final negotiations to helm the movie project centering on one of Spider-Man’s signature villains. The character is an alien symbiote that needs a human host to survive. The project is one of Sony’s top priorities and the studio is not wasting time as the movie is set to open Oct. 5, 2018. Venom is to usher in a host of movies from Sony\\'s Marvel and Spider-Man-based universe of characters (we could even see a Carnage movie, Tom Holland as the black symbiote Spider-Man or in the Iron Spider Suit we seen in Spider-Man Homecoming). \n\nSony is rebooting its Marvel-based slate with this summer’s Spider-Man: Homecoming and Venom is a key title in its slate. The studio is also developing a Silver Sable/Black Cat project among other characters from the Spider-Man stable.\n\nWhether Marvel\\'s vision will incorporate Sony\\'s previously proposed spin-offs or try something new is unclear, but it\\'s hard to deny that Spider-Man’s future with the studio is looking very bright indeed. Tom Holland in Spider-Man Homecoming was \"Spectacular\" and will hopefully make the studios secure future Spidey movies! We would love to see Marvel & Sony bring Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield back somehow as alternate Spider-Men in a huge Spider-Verse Movie crossover, perhaps even with Miles Morales (Donald Glover?) along side them.\n\n──────────────────\n\n**This is a Concept Trailer.

Chosen the world's protector against the Seven Deadly Enemies of Man -- pride, envy, greed, hatred, selfishness, laziness and injustice -- young Billy Batson accepts his destiny as Captain Marvel. Battling alongside Superman against nefarious Black Adam, Billy soon discovers the challenge super heroes ultimately face: is it revenge or justice? For bounty hunter Jonah Hex and hard-boiled cop turned vengeance ghost The Spectre, getting their hands dirty is part of the job -- maybe even the fun part. But Superman, Green Arrow and Black Canary follow an internal moral code to guide their actions. They know it's easy to get lost in the darkness of the fight, especially when villans like Merlyn the Magnificent and Count Vertigo place no value on human life."
